# Mini-Drawing-Project
I created a simple mini drawing project with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The purpose for the project was to design a simple drawing application for making drawing purpose which includes the home page, color change button, color size button, clear screen button.
The main motivation towards the designing the application is to utilize the chance given by the respected faculty to develop the application in some good work which will remain.
In this project we have used basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript tools and technologies as well as some canvas tools and version control system like git and github.
